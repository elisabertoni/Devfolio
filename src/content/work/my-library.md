As part of an assignment for the Dev Academy bootcamp, I had to develop a full-stack project using most of the technologies learnt in class. 

This was my first solo full-stack app and also includes unit testing covering over 80% of functions in the repository. Testing was definitely the most challenging part of the project!

Technology used:
- React and Redux for state management 
- Knex for SQLite3 query builder
- SQLite3 for database development and production
- Jest for testing
- Bulma for styling
- Dokku for deployment

The website was then deployed using Dokku and can be found [here](https://elisa-fullstack-book-collection.devacademy.nz/). For the GitHub repo click [here](https://github.com/elisabertoni/my-library).
