Gallerina was developed for our final Dev Academy group project. We developed an art curation website which allows a user to create their own idyllic collections of some of the most famous art pieces in the world.

I developed the homepage layout and features, and also contributed to the styling of the entire website. At first, the homepage might look simple but it is actually packed with functionalities, starting from the dropdown which was a real challenge to code and was implemented by using Headless UI.

Technology used:
- React and Redux for state management 
- Knex for SQLite3 query builder
- SQLite3 for database development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Artsy API as the external API
- Headless UI

The external API was very difficult to deal with. We also run out of time and didn't do any unit testing. 

Gallerina hasn't been deployed yet but the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/tohora-2023/Gallerina).
