> Gallerina is an art curation website that allows users to create their own idyllic collections of some of the most famous art pieces in the world.

<br>
<br>
Gallerina was developed over five days as our final group project for Dev Academy .

I was responsible for developing the homepage layout and features and also contributed to the styling of the entire website using Tailwind CSS. Although the homepage may appear simple, it is actually packed with functionality, starting with the heart dropdown, which was a real challenge to code and was implemented using different Headless UI components.



**Stack used includes:**
- React and Redux for state management 
- Knex as SQLite3 query builder
- SQLite3 for database development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Artsy API as the external API
- Headless UI

Setting up the external API was particularly difficult, and unfortunately, we ran out of time and did not do any unit testing.

Gallerina hasn't been deployed yet but the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/elisabertoni/gallerina).
