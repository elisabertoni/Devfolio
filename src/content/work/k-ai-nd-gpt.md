I developed K-ai-ndGPT as part of a 24-hour group project with other 2 students from my Dev Academy cohort. 

The objective of this project was to use an external API and we used OpenAI API to develop a kind Chatbot.

It was pretty challenging to set up this external API because the official OpenAPI documentation was using the 'fetch' method and none of us were familiar with.
