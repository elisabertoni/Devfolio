I developed K-ai-ndGPT as part of a 24-hour group project with two other students from my Dev Academy cohort. 

The objective of this project was to use an external API, and we used the OpenAI API to develop a kind chatbot.

Our main challenge was incorporating the external API into our front-end, as most tutorials and documentation were using the 'fetch' method, which none of us were familiar with because we only used 'superagent' during lectures. After some googling (and a little help from a facilitator!), we finally got this working.
